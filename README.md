# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the classic **Titanic Dataset**! This project is part of an AI & ML internship task designed to help understand the dataset using both **statistics** and **visualizations**. 📊🧠

---

 📌 Objective

The main objective of this task is to:
- Understand the Titanic dataset
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis
- Use visual tools to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Gain insights into how data can be used to prepare for machine learning

---

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- 🐍 Python
- 📦 Pandas
- 📈 Matplotlib
- 🧼 Seaborn

🔍 EDA Process

Here's what I did step by step:

1. **Loaded the data** and checked for missing values and basic structure
2. **Generated descriptive statistics** (mean, median, std, etc.)
3. **Visualized univariate distributions** using histograms and boxplots
4. **Explored categorical data** using count plots
5. **Analyzed feature relationships** using:
   - Correlation matrix (heatmap)
   - Pairplots
   - Age distribution by survival
6. **Detected skewness** and potential outliers
7. **Documented all findings** with code and charts

---

📊 Key Visualizations

- Survival count distribution
- Passenger class vs survival
- Age and Fare distributions
- Correlation matrix of numeric features
- Age distribution segmented by survival

---

📈 Key Insights

- **Females and higher-class passengers had higher survival rates**
- **Younger passengers had a slightly higher chance of survival**
- **Fare and Pclass are moderately correlated with survival**

---

📁 Files Included

- `titanic-Dataset.csv` — dataset file
- `EDA.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with all code and visuals
- And other images that were generated by the visualization tools like matplotlib, seaborn

✅ Conclusion

This EDA gives a clear understanding of the Titanic dataset and is a crucial first step before applying machine learning models. Proper data understanding can lead to better feature selection and improved predictions! 💡🤖
